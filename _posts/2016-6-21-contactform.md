How does a web form work?

The working of a web form

* A visitor visits a web page that contains a form.
* The web browser displays the HTML form.
* The visitor fills in the form and submits
* The browser sends the submitted form data to the web server
* A form processor script running on the web server processes the form data. 

The processing steps can include:
sending the form submission by email
saving the submission to a database table or a file.
A response page is sent back to the browser.
