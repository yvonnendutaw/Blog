Scrum is an agile framework that is used to manage and complete complex problems. A software developer would define scrum as an agile development method used in software development. Scrum was originally for software development but it can work for any other type of project.

The scrum technique is a framework not a methodology. It is mainly used to manage time and resources. It works best for complicated projects and is even better for team projects!

Scrum(scrummage) in rugby describes a method of restarting a stoppage. In a scrum, the team players do not work as individuals but as a unit of strength and power. This is basivcally the main objectibve of scrum.

### Steps in implementing scrum


#### Get your backlog in order

Know what you want to do as a team and how it is going to be done. Write everything down. Allocate the work and make sure everyone knos their role. 

#### Work in Progress

Here, we include the work being done at the time. This comes after allocation, where everyone is working on their part of the project. Work is broken into smaller chunks which makes everything simpler and faster.

#### Completed

After everyone has completed their chunk of work, everything is placed on this section. It is after everyone is finished that the product is released,or the project is termed complete.
